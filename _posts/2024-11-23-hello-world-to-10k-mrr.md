title: "From 'Hello World' to $10K MRR"

Iâ€™m starting a journey to go from **Hello World** to **$10K MRR** by building a software business using **Ruby on Rails**.

This idea was inspired by the [Ruby on Rails headline](https://rubyonrails.org): *"Hello World to IPO."* But letâ€™s be realâ€”getting to an IPO might take 10 years (or more!). So, for now, Iâ€™ll focus on hitting $10K MRR, which feels more manageable and trendy these days.


## A Little Background

Originally, I planned to build a web design and digital marketing agency called [Light Launch Studio](https://lightlaunchstudio.com), targeting the design and build niche. The idea was simple: hit $10K MRR and grow it until I could afford a nice house and travel the world.

On paper, this makes sense. Selling websites with monthly subscriptions (like $500/month to 20 clients) is a proven modelâ€”just look at [99Sites](https://99sites.io) and similar agencies. Itâ€™s a clear path to $10K MRR.

But something feltâ€¦ off.

While I enjoy building websites and dabbling in SEO, I realized I donâ€™t want to spend all my time doing just that. My real dream has always been to create a **SaaS**. I want to build a software business, market it, and grow it into something incredible.

So, Iâ€™m pivoting! Iâ€™m ditching the web design agency to chase my SaaS dream. I'll Reach $10K MRR, scale the business, maybe IPO someday, and (eventually) buy a yacht, a ferrari, or whatever else people do with that kind of money.


## The Big Question: How Do I Do This?

Honestly, I donâ€™t have it all figured out yet. But I have some ideas and a plan. And Iâ€™m going to share my entire journey with youâ€”right here on this blog and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SpikeVinzCruz).

Hereâ€™s the game plan:


### Step 1: Pick a Niche
Iâ€™m starting with what I'm recently interested in: the **Design and Build Industry**.
Iâ€™ll focus on businesses that can afford to pay for software and are willing to invest in tools that solve their problems.


### Step 2: Find an Idea
Hereâ€™s the strategy:
- Copy a successful SaaS business.
- Make it niche-specific.
- Cut out all the fluff.
- Make the core feature 10x better. 


### Step 3: Validate the Idea
- Sell the idea to **5 early access users** (offer a lifetime deal).
- Set up payment (using PayPal for now).
- Set up booking (with Calendly).
- Do **100 cold DMs, cold calls, and cold emails** until I get 5 paying users.
- If I canâ€™t get 5 users, go back to Step 2 and refine the idea.


### Step 4: Build the App
- Work closely with early access users. 
- Build the MVP (minimum viable product).
- Deploy the app and fix bugs until users are happy.


### Step 5: Scale the App
- Start with organic outreach: create social media content, blog posts, and YouTube videos.
- Continue cold outreach: aim for **10 new users per week**.
- Build funnel and email marketing campaign.
- Keep improving the app and fixing bugs.


## A Few Final Thoughts

These steps might not work. But theyâ€™re a starting point, based on everything Iâ€™ve learned from the handful YouTube videos and blog posts about starting a SaaS.

Iâ€™ll tweak this blueprint as I go, and Iâ€™ll share every success (and failure) along the way.

If youâ€™re on a similar journey, letâ€™s do this together! Share your thoughts, feedback, and ideas so we can all learn and grow.

The ultimate goal? $10K MRR and, maybe one day, financial freedom.
