title: "How I became a Developer"
---

It was 2020, the pandemic hit, and I was 19 years old, bored, and looking for ways to make money online. Naturally, I Googled “how to make money online.” And *boom!* The internet threw a ton of ideas at me: SMMA, Copywriting, affiliate marketing—you name it. But most of them? Just people trying to sell their expensive courses. Yeah, no thanks.

I tried SMMA (Social Media Marketing) first and learned Facebook ads, but then reality hit me—I didn’t have the money to actually run ads. So, I moved on to blogging and affiliate marketing, but guess what? You need money for hosting and domains too. Who knew trying to make money *required* money?

Then, I found Copywriting. I figured, “Hey, maybe this is the one!” But there was one small problem. I. Sucked. At. Writing. Still, I gave it a shot. I even read this blog that said handwriting sales letters would help me get better. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. I read some the books about marketing and persuasion, but I couldn’t get into it. It didn't click to me. So, I moved on again.

Then, I stumbled on a YouTube video saying web developers make good money. That caught my attention. I started following along with tutorials on YouTube, but the moment I’d finish one, I’d forget everything. I felt lost, and almost gave up because I couldn't learn a thing.

But then, I found [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com). And *this* was different. It didn’t hold your hand. I had to actually *do* things on my own, and yes, fail a lot. But I learned that failure wasn’t bad—it was part of the process. Every time I fixed an error, I felt like I’d just beaten a boss in a video game. That dopamine hit kept me going.

Eventually, I built my first website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My first project? Replicating the Google Search page from scratch. It was a challenge, but a fun one. Then, I got to the Ruby on Rails section, and when I wrote my first line of Ruby code, I was like, “Wait, this is *so* simple?” I instantly fell in love with how elegant the language was.

From there, I built web apps using Ruby on Rails, learned how to Google like a pro, and even figured out how to ask questions without sounding completely clueless.

**Moral of the story?** Just build stuff. Don’t know how to do it? Start small and Google it. Get stuck? Ask for help. Keep repeating this, and *boom!* Next thing you know, you’re a developer.

And that’s how I became a developer. Not a bad way to spend a pandemic, huh?

## What’s next on my journey?

I’m thinking about making SaaS products or startups as a solo dev in the next few months. Right now, I’m collecting and searching for ideas. Most of them are dumb, but a few have some potential. I have *no* idea how to market or sell things, but honestly? It’s the same as learning to code—I’ll figure it out along the way.

I expect a lot of the products I make will flop, and that’s okay. If I keep going, eventually, I’ll have at least one that works, makes me money, and hopefully, I won’t have to stress about cash anymore. I just need to make sure I don’t procrastinate and give up... though let’s be real, I’ll probably procrastinate. *Haha.*
