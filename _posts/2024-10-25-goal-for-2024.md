title: "Late Goals for 2024"
---

It's already October, why bother writing a goal?

Welp, I'll just write this for accountability purposes.

## By December 31, 2024, I aim to achieve the following:

- Reach at least 10 paying clients for Light Launch Studio
- Focus on interior design businesses as my primary web design niche
- Outreach to at least 1,000 leads

That's all, Bye!
