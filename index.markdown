Hey, I’m a Ruby on Rails developer with 3+ years of experience. I love the elegance of Ruby—it's like writing poetry in code. I started self-teaching during the pandemic with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), then took a coding bootcamp at [Avion School](https://www.avionschool.com/), which landed me my first job. When I’m not coding, I’m playing Sepak Takraw, diving into manhwa/manga, gaming (currently on Honor of Kings), or night diving for spearfishing. Always up for a new challenge, whether it’s in code or on an adventure!
